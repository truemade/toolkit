# Toolkit
Community Tools to help map creation for True Skate.

Initial sources were provided by TS Dev team to provide the minimal information to create and export a playable map in True Skate mobile game.

This repository consists of:

### SCRIPTS ###
The scripts were created to be used in Blender (script/add-on) or as a support tool

### SOURCE ###
True Skate uses a group of Blender nodes materials that will be exported as an FBX with properties.
To convert the FBX for visible geometry and collision geometry, TS devs provided a FBXtoTRUESKATE converter source that can be generated by building the project source.
